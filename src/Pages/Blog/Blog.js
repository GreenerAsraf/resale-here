              <li>Local state</li>
              <li>Global state</li>
              <li>Server state</li>

Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation. This testing methodology is done during the development process by the software developers and sometimes QA staff. 
<p>
The main objective of unit testing is to isolate written code to test and determine if it works as intended.Unit testing is an important step in the development process, because  it can help to detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages.
